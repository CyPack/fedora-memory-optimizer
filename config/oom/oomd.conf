# Fedora Memory Optimizer - systemd-oomd Configuration
# ====================================================
#
# systemd-oomd is a PASSIVE BACKUP to earlyoom
# It uses PSI (Pressure Stall Information) for smarter decisions
#
# Strategy:
#   - Very high thresholds (only trigger when truly critical)
#   - Long duration before action (give earlyoom time to work)
#   - This is the LAST LINE OF DEFENSE before kernel OOM
#

[OOM]
# SwapUsedLimit: Kill when swap usage exceeds this percentage
# Set high because earlyoom handles 90%, this is backup at 95%
SwapUsedLimit=95%

# DefaultMemoryPressureLimit: Memory pressure threshold
# Higher value = less aggressive
DefaultMemoryPressureLimit=80%

# DefaultMemoryPressureDurationSec: How long pressure must be sustained
# 60 seconds gives plenty of time for earlyoom and manual intervention
DefaultMemoryPressureDurationSec=60s
